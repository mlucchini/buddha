Simple Arduino sketches to troubleshoot issues with individual components.
For convenience, GPIO pins are expected to be the same as the pins used by the project.

This is typically used to setup a new servo, making sure that the motor behaves as expected
and that both the driver and the absolute encoder are connected properly to the Arduino 
board before connecting the servos to the platform.
